A project designed to test my ability to use HTML to create a basic recipe website, consisting of a home page and at least 3 recipe pages. Having completed this project, I have demonstrated my ability to:

- create a HTML boilerplate
- add images
- add headings of various sizes
- add paragraphs
- create unordered lists
- create ordered lists
- create hyperlinks to other HTML files
- appropriately organise my files
- use Git and Github effectively
