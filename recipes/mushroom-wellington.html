        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190&deg;C.</li>
            <li>Remove the puff pastry from the fridge to let it soften.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the mushrooms and slice the onion.</li>
            <li>Peel and slice the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tbsp of olive oil to a pan and add the onion until translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetable broth, garlic, mushrooms, soy sauce, thyme and spinach.</li>
            <li>Mix and take off the heat when cooked through.</li>
            <li>Carefully unroll the puff pastry onto a baking tray.</li>
            <li>On the central third of the puff pastry, place a layer of about 1/3 of the potato slices.</li>
            <li>Spread half of your mushroom mix onto the potato layer.</li>
            <li>Add another layer of potatoes and then mushroom mix.</li>
            <li>Add a final layer of potatoes.</li>
            <li>Fold the sides of the puff pastry over the potato layers and pinch the top and bottom of the pastry together to completely incase the filling.</li>
            <li>Score the top of the pastry diagonally in both directions.</li>
            <li>Top with an 'egg wash' mix of olive oil and milk.</li>
            <li>Stab a few holes into the top of the pastry to create air vents.</li>
            <li>Place in the oven for 35-40 mins until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
