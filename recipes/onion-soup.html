            <li>Cut your baguette into slices so that each serving gets two.</li>

            <li>Place the bread slices in the oven for a couple minutes until the cheese has melted and the bread has crisped up.</li>
            <li>While the bread slices are toasting, remove and discard the bayleaf from the soup before ladling the soup into bowls.</li>
