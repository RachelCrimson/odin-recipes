        <h1>Sushi Bake</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A tasty twist on a sushi, that uses cooked fish and requires none of the challenging assembly.
            It is easily customisable, switching out the fish, toppings or some of the sauces to create a delicious dish tailored to your palette.
            With minimal fresh food needed, it's a great back up meal midweek.
            Just keep some salmon in the freezer, unopened cream cheese in the fridge, spring onions in some water and the rest in your pantry.
            All you have to remember to get is cucumber, which if you're like me, is a regular purchase anyway.
            It is easily customisable, switching out the fish, toppings or some of the sauces to create a delicious dish tailored to your palette.
            Using tinned tuna, is a fantastic, quick and easy alternative!</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C.</li>
            <!--temp lower than what I normally do? also add degree symbol-->
            <li>Rinse your rice until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions with your rice cooker for the appropriate amount of water to add and then start your rice cooker.</li>
            <!--rephrase?-->
            <li>Once the oven is preheated, place your salmon fillets on a baking tray in the center of the oven for 15-20mins until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Slice up your spring onion, keeping the whites and greens separate.</li>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked, pour it into your baking dish.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, add your rice vinegar and sugar along with 1/2 teaspoon of MSG.</li>
            <li>Heat the mixture in the microwave in 30sec increments, stirring in between, until everything is dissolved.</li>
            <!--check microwave increments-->
            <li>Pour the mixture over your cooked rice and mix it through, before spreading the rice evenly across the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Remove the skin off of your cooked salmon and place the salmon meat into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Optionally, you can put the salmon skin back in the oven to crisp up and eat alongside the sushi bake.</li>
            <li>Break up the salmon meat with a fork until separated into smaller chunks.</li>
            <li>Add the cream cheese, mayonnaise, soy sauce, sriracha, spring onion whites and 1/8 teaspoon of MSG to the salmon meat and stir until evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>Spread the salmon mixture evenly over the rice in the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place in the center of the oven for 15-20mins.</li>
            <li>Slice up your cucumber and place in a small dish to be served alongside the sushi bake.</li>
            <li>Cut your nori sheets into quarters.</li>
            <li>Once the sushi bake is cooked through, top it with the sesame seeds and green spring onions.</li>
            <li>Dish it up and serve alongside the cucumber, nori sheets and crispy salmon skins.</li>
        </ol>
